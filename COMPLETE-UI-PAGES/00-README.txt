COMPLETE UI PAGES - EXACT SOURCE CODE
======================================

This directory contains the complete, unmodified source code for every UI page 
that exists in this project. Each file contains 100% of the original code.

NO BACKEND CODE INCLUDED
-------------------------
These are pure UI/frontend files only. They may contain imports to:
- React hooks
- UI components
- Contexts
- Services

But you should replace those with your own backend/data layer.

ORGANIZATION
------------
Files are numbered and grouped by category:

01-09:  Main App Pages (Index, Home, Profile, etc.)
10-19:  Feature Pages (Live, Watch, Marketplace, Messages, etc.)
20-49:  Content Pages (Albums, Blog, Books, Dating, Events, etc.)
50-59:  Auth Pages (Login, Register, Verification, etc.)
60-99:  Admin Pages (Dashboard, Users, Settings, etc.)

HOW TO USE
----------
1. Copy the entire page code from any file
2. Remove Supabase/backend imports
3. Replace data fetching with your own backend
4. Keep all UI structure, styling, components as-is

Each page filename clearly indicates what it contains.
